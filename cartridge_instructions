This program creates Version 1 and Version 1.1 IMS common cartridge (CC) formats and stages the zip/imscc
files into the cartridgeStagingPath setting from the given plist file.

Current active plist kit files are located in the /Users/eslcd/etc/plist/ directory

Here's the steps to create a cartridge:
    1. Create new cartridge plist XML file. The easiest way to do this is copy an existing file with a new name
       and edit the file with the new data.
    2. Run the modTest.pl on the xml/plist file after the content has been pushed to the production server
    3. Run the buildCartridge.pl program with the newly created plist file as the only argument. e.g.
       buildCartridge.pl ~eslcd/etc/plist/2E_Physical_Geology_Kit7103_Standard.plist
    4. Review the output sent to the terminal for any warnings or errors
    5. Done

Anatomy of a kit plist file
The plist XML file contains the kit/course metadata and the corresponding labs. IMPORTANT! lab names and
kit paths must exectly match the directory names that are created in the /Users/eslcd/ProductionFeed/V3
hierarchy.

Also, once a cartridge has been delivered to a customer, the directory names cannot be changed without
reloading the cartridge on the customer side. 

Contents of the plist XML file:
    targetPath
        The location of the top level directory for this kit. It is used by rsync (printSync) to push the content.
        sourcePath
        Location of the top level directory to pull from. also used by the rsync program. The root path is always
        /Users/eslcd/ProductionFeed/V3/ and the remaining path will be different for each category and kit. e.g.
        /Users/eslcd/ProductionFeed/V3/Microbiology/UNT6200_Northern_Texas_Microbiology/
    pemPath
        the location of the pem file. Used to connect to the production server.
    title
        The title of the kit.
    sku
        The SKU for the kit
    httpPath
        The top level https path to the kit. e.g.
        https://esciencelabs.com/sites/default/files/V3/Microbiology/UNT6200_Northern_Texas_Microbiology/
    kitName
        Name of the kit. Usually the top level directory name. e.g. UNT6200_Northern_Texas_Microbiology
        cartridgeStagingPath
    Top level path to store cartridge files:
        /Users/eslcd/ProductionFeed/Cartridges/Microbiology/UNT6200_Northern_Texas_Microbiology/. This
        directory is created automatically.
    modules
        An array of labs defined by a dictionary structure for each lab. The structure will always be the same but
        the content will be different for each kit/course.
    array
        Starting tag of the array
    dict
        The dictionary structure for a lab. This structure is repeated for each lab in the kit.
    title
        Title of the lab.
    name
        Name of the directory used for the lab. Can only contain alpha numeric characters. i.e. no embedded
        white space and/or special characters. e.g. MB_UNT6200_L00_Getting_Started. It is also case
        sensitive.
        
Description of modTest.pl [required plist file]
    A PERL script wrapper around the printCURL program. This script creates the shell scripts and runs them
    automatically. The plist file parameter is required.
        Examples
        Best way to use the labTest.pl script is dump it to a file and do a grep on the HTTP header for status
        To test a single kit/plist:
            1. modTest.pl etc/plist/UNT6200_Northern_Texas_Microbiology.plist > curl.out
            2. grep -in http curl.out
            If you see something other than a HTTP 200 OK in the output for any invocation of the modTest.pl script, you have
            a problem. The number before the colon in the output is the line location in the curl.out file and that is how you
            locate the problem lab. It usually means there is a mismatch between the filepath created by the plist and the 
            actual location of the file. If everything matches, then the content probably needs to be pushed to production.
