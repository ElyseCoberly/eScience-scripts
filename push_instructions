This document contains procedures and notes on pushing Storyline (V3) content to the production server
(weblive1).

All StoryLine-V3 source content lives in /Users/eslcd/ProductionFeed/V3 and is organized by subject matter
under the V3 directory.
All the shell (.sh) scripts below are located in the /Users/eslcd/bin/ directory. This document assumes you are
logged into stromboli as the eslcd user.
The shell scripts listed below push the top level parent directory and all child directories to the production server.
    pushESL.sh
        push the entire ESL Storyline hierarchy (/var/www/esl/public_html/sites/default/files/V3) to
        production. Depending on the amount of content that has been modified, this can take minutes or hours to
        complete.
    pushAlliedHealth.sh
        push the AlliedHealth hierarchy to production.
    pushPharmaTech.sh
        push the PharmacyTechnician hierarchy to production.
    pushAP.sh
        push the AnatomyAndPhysiology hierarchy to production.
    pushAstronomy.sh
        push the Astronomy hierarchy to production.
    pushBiology.sh
        push the Biology hierarchy to production.
    pushChem.sh
        push the Chemistry hierarchy to production.
    pushEnviroScience.sh
        push the EnvironmentalScience hierarchy to production.
    pushForensics.sh
        push the Forensics hierarchy to production.
    pushGeology.sh
        push the Geology hierarchy to production.
    pushHumanBiology.sh
        push the HumanBiology hierarchy to production.
    pushMicro.sh
        push the Microbiology hierarchy to production.
    pushPhysicalScience.sh
        push the PhysicalScience hierarchy to production.
    pushPhysics.sh
        push the Physics hierarchy to production.
    pushSampleLabs.sh
        push the Sample Labs hierarchy to production. There are no cartridges or complete kits associated with
        this directory structure.

For example, to push the Microbiology top level hierarchy to production, you would do the following from a
terminal/shell window:
    pushMicro.sh
        1. Enter the pem password located in your creds.txt file, if prompted to do so.
        2. Push script begins...
The other scripts do the same thing for the differenct top level directories.
